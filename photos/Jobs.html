                <h2 class="titles2"> Slice Order Policy - Effective July 27th, 2015.</h2>
            <p class="faq">Slices are no longer available for delivery starting July 27th, 2015. <br> Instead, we now offer two additional sizes of pies. All of our pizzas are available in 18", 16", and 12" sizes.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2">Future Orders:</h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">We welcome you to call days, weeks, or even months in advance to order Mesa Pizza pies <br>for your meeting or party, because it's good to plan ahead. <br>Mesa Pizza looks forward to catering your next event!

            <br>We can provide plates and napkins if you need them, just ask us! <br>We also offer a big group salad, which serves roughly 10 people. The big salad is $30 and needs to be ordered at least a day in advance.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> How many people does one of your pizzas feed? </h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">Good question, although it is hard to give a definite answer because we donâ€™t know how hungry you are. An 18" pizza (18" diameter) <br>typically feeds 5-6 people (or 4 to 5 college students). A 16" pizza typically feeds 3-4 people, and a 12" pizza typically feeds 1 to 3 people.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> How many slices do you cut the pizza into?</h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">We automatically cut 18" and 16" pizzas into 8 slices, but if you would like us to cut it into 16 slices or squares, we can do that too. We cut 12" pizzas into 6 slices.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> Do you accept checks? </h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">We DO NOT accept personal checks, but we take business or organizational checks. Checks from the University, Fraternities, Sororities, <br> Non-Profit groups, and Companies are accepted.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> Do you have Gift Cards?</h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">Yes! We have the credit-card-style gift cards that you can load up for any amount. Give one to your friends as a Birthday or Holiday gift, <br> or just because you like them! Additionally, we can mail it to you if you live far away. Please keep in mind that these gift cards are store specific, <br> in other words, Dinkytown gift cards work only at Dinkytown, Uptown gift cards work only at Uptown, etc.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> I need a copy of my receipt, what should I do? </h3></strong>
            <p class="faq"> If you need a copy of your receipt, be sure to grab your copy from the driver when they drop off your pizza, they will always have a copy available for you. <br> If you forget to do that, call Mesa during the afternoon, and we can look you up and print you another copy. <br> When you call, be sure to have the date of the delivery, along with the last 4 digits of the credit card number <br> used to pay for the pizza.</p><br>

            <strong><h3 class="titles2"> Why won't you deliver to me? I live just outside of your delivery zone! </h3></strong>
            <p class="faq">We understand your frustration, but unfortunately we have to set the boundary somewhere. You can always order a pizza for Pick-Up, and it will be delicious!</p><br>
